-  Hi, I’m @HybridCoco
-  I’m interested in learning new coding language.
-  I am a young learner and am not an expert in learning or coding i am a starter.
- This is the first thing i created properly after learning these things.
- Yes i did the HTML stuff myself (Little bit of help) but the CSS and the JS was completely learned from online.

- @AsmrProg is an amazing youtube channel from whom you can see him build different kind of projects and you can learn from it.
- Though he dosent directly explain anything but you can learn by seeing things.
